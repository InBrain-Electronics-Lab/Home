  PhD Student, Biomedical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology<br>
  Master of BioEngineering, Applied Bioengineering, Rice University<br>
  Bachelor of Science, Cellular & Molecular Biology: Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan<br>
  
Sara has expertise in bipolar and multipolar electrical sensing and stimulation applications in the medical device industry. Before joining the InBrain Electronics Lab, she spent three years focused on Cardiac Rhythm Management at Abbott, troubleshooting and programming pacemakers and defibrillators. Before Abbott, she was the Lead Product Development Engineer at a startup called XN Health, developing a novel multipolar basket catheter for trans-tracheal electrical stimulation. Before completing her Master's at Rice, Sara was an ORISE Fellow at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the FDA in the Division of Applied Mechanics, focused on the development of safety parameters for ultrasound permeation of the Blood-Brain Barrier, as well as COVID-19 Infection Modeling.

Research Interests: Visual Prosthetics, Flexible Microelectronics, Chemical Sensing<br>
Hobbies: Soccer, Hiking, 3D Printing, Hanging out with my dog Lincoln

  Undergraduate Student, Biomedical Engineering, a concentration in Neuroengineering and Biomedical Imaging, Stevens Institute of Technology<br>

As part of her biomedical engineering curriculum at Stevens Institute of Technology, Julia has completed a range of projects spanning biomaterials, digital signal processing, biosensors, biomechanics, circuits, and dynamical systems. Through this work, she has developed strong hands-on proficiency in engineering design and simulation tools, including MATLAB, SolidWorks, COMSOL, and Simulink. In addition, Julia serves as an Undergraduate Laboratory and Grading Assistant for two sophomore-level engineering courses, ENGR 245 (Circuits and Systems) and ENGR 212 (Design of Dynamical Systems), where she supports students in circuit implementation, characterization, and system modeling, while further strengthening her technical and instructional expertise.

Research Interests: Implantable neuroprosthetics and neurorehabilitation technology<br>
Hobbies: Snowboarding, Traveling, 3D Design, Playing Guitar, and Reading.
