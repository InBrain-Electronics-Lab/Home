## Dr. Tiago Costa

🌐 **[Visit MITUS Lab](https://mitus-lab.netlify.app/)**

Dr. Tiago Costa leads the MIcroengineering Therapeutic UltraSound (MITUS) Lab at Delft University of Technology. His research group develops next-generation implantable and wearable therapeutic ultrasound technologies with a focus on miniaturization, high power efficiency, and advanced acoustic control. The MITUS lab combines analog and mixed-signal circuit design, micro-/nanofabrication, and acoustic physics to create compact ultrasound devices capable of precise beam focusing, steering, and acoustic holography. These technologies are validated from benchtop experiments to pre-clinical models and human studies, targeting improved therapeutic interventions such as neuromodulation and other biomedical applications.

## Dr. Claudia Cea

🌐 **[Visit Cea Lab](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/claudia-cea)**

Dr. Claudia Cea leads The Cea Lab at Yale University, developing soft, multifunctional bioelectronic interfaces designed to modulate and monitor activity in the peripheral nervous system, with a particular interest in the gut–brain axis. Her lab engineers flexible, conformable devices that interface with visceral organs and associated neural circuits to enable precise electrical stimulation and recording in gastrointestinal tissues, integrating organic bioelectronic materials, microfabrication, and multimodal sensing technologies to create minimally invasive systems capable of long-term gut modulation and to advance new therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders.

## Dr. Xenofon Strakosas

🌐 **[Visit Lab of Organic Electronics](https://liu.se/en/research/laboratory-of-organic-electronics)**

At the Laboratory of Organic Electronics (LOE) at Linköping University, Dr. Xenofon Strakosas conducts research focused on the development of organic electronic materials and bioelectronic interfaces that seamlessly communicate with biological systems. His work spans conductive polymers and mixed ion-electron conducting materials tailored for soft, biocompatible devices capable of sensing and stimulating tissues. A key element of the lab’s research involves visible-light–driven photopolymerization and photopatterning techniques to form conductive polymer structures and electrodes directly on flexible substrates and biological surfaces, advancing scalable, gentle fabrication methods for next-generation bioelectronics.
